# Buffer Underrun Optimizations

## Summary of Changes

The following optimizations were implemented to eliminate buffer underruns and improve audio stability:

### 1. Enhanced Buffer Management
- **Increased buffer size**: From 10 frames to 30 frames (`buffer_frames` in config.json)
- **Dynamic buffer thresholds**: 
  - Minimum buffer: 5 frames (1/6 of max)
  - Target buffer: 10 frames (1/3 of max) 
  - Pre-fill buffer: 15 frames (1/2 of max)

### 2. Buffer State Management
- **States**: `initializing` → `pre_filling` → `playing` → `recovering`
- **Pre-fill mechanism**: Waits for buffer to fill before starting playback
- **Recovery mode**: Automatically enters recovery when consecutive underruns occur
- **Health scoring**: Tracks buffer stability (0-100%)

### 3. Smart Audio Callback
- **Zero-underrun design**: Only plays audio when buffer is healthy
- **Advanced concealment**: Fade-out audio during underruns for smooth playback
- **Reduced logging spam**: Only logs every 100th underrun
- **Performance tracking**: Monitors callback timing and health

### 4. Improved Packet Processing
- **State-aware buffering**: Different buffer behavior during init vs. normal playback
- **Overflow protection**: Intelligent frame dropping for low latency
- **Ultra-fast pre-fill**: Optimized buffer filling during startup

### 5. Configuration Updates
- **Buffer frames**: Increased from 10 to 30
- **Jitter buffer**: Increased from 5 to 8 packets
- **Socket buffer**: Maintained at 32KB for optimal network performance

## Key Features for Zero Underruns

1. **Buffer Pre-fill**: System waits for adequate buffer before starting playback
2. **Adaptive Recovery**: Automatically recovers from underrun conditions
3. **Smart Concealment**: Smooth audio transitions during any remaining underruns
4. **Health Monitoring**: Real-time buffer health tracking and adaptation
5. **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive underrun and performance tracking

## Expected Results

- **Dramatically reduced buffer underruns** (target: <1% of previous levels)
- **Smoother audio playback** with seamless recovery
- **Better startup behavior** with proper buffer pre-fill
- **Enhanced stability** under network stress conditions
- **Improved latency consistency** while maintaining ultra-low latency

## Monitoring

The system now provides enhanced monitoring with:
- Buffer health score (0-100%)
- Consecutive underrun tracking
- Buffer state information
- Recovery mode notifications
- Detailed performance metrics

These optimizations should eliminate the majority of buffer underruns while maintaining the ultra-low latency performance characteristics of the system.
